Textures are rendered base on points with coordinates.

This way we do not need to know if it's scaled, rotated, moved.
We just follow 4 points(by default 4) with coordinates of each corner.

This way it can be also nicely integrated with HTML and CSS, gaining all the benefits of all css transformations.
We just need to read coordinates of each corner from HTML and pass those to creator.
